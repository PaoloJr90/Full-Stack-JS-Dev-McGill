> SQL --> Structured Query Language; a declarative language to interact with relational databases.\
> Relational --> rows and columns of data in tables.\
> NoSQL --> document-based ("documents in a collection"), key-value pairs, graph-based, etc.\

- NoSQL databases are more flexible and scalable than relational databases\
- NoSQL databases are not as good at handling complex queries as relational databases\
