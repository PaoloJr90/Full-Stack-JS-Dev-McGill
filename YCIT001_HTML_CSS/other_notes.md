HTML:

- A markup language deriving from XML (Extensible Markup Language)
- Not a programming language. A markup language; to describe things.

HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag: <br> - Name including braces (<> & </>) <br> - Tags: names/directions within the elements <br> - Attributes: metadata about the element <br> - Comment start/end: `<!--   -->` <br>
<br>

- `<strong>` and `<em>` tags are preferred as they can be further styled in CSS
- `<cite>` used as a reference. Used in SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
- .ICO (favicon/icon) files are used in the browser tabs and password managers' display
- Id and Class are references and are similar to creating variables that are later referred to

_Box model_:

- Padding is clickable
- Margin is not clickable
